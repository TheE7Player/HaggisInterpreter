# Haggis Interpreter
 *An Interpreter written in C# to simulate the reference language*



> There is no available .exe at the current time as I am still developing the main logic.

> Add this code to a new C# project (Library for Interpreter, Console for running the Interpreter )

> *( Haven't added args yet - thats why... don't tell anyone! )*



Haggis is a reference language used in SQA Exams from `National 4` up to `Advanced Higher`.

This project that I am developing will act if its an actual language that could operate (it isn't)

**PROJECT IS STILL IN DEVELOPEMENT**

|  Folder   |                     Contents                      |
| :-------: | :-----------------------------------------------: |
|   /Lib    |      Holds the interpreter itself (**.dll**)      |
|   /Test   | Holds the code testing the interpreter (**.exe**) |
| /Examples | Holds the scripts to run the tests (**.haggis**)  |



The current scripts runs without any errors:

> There is more scripts as I started the project initially from another forked C# interpreter, had issues after a few days - So I did it by scratch to simplify things.
