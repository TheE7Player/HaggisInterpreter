# Haggis Interpreter
 *An Interpreter written in C# to simulate the reference language*


Haggis is a reference language used in SQA Exams from `National 4` up to `Advanced Higher`.

This project that I am developing will act if its an actual language that could operate (it isn't)	

You may try out the language as an executable, [here](https://github.com/TheE7Player/HaggisInterpreter/releases).
> Note: This project is still in development and doesn't evaluate the language as a whole yet!

**PROJECT IS STILL IN DEVELOPEMENT**

|  Folder   |                     Contents                      |
| :-------: | :-----------------------------------------------: |
|   /Lib    |      Holds the interpreter itself (**.dll**)      |
|   /Test   | Holds the code testing the interpreter (**.exe**) |
| /Examples | Holds the scripts to run the tests (**.haggis**)  |



You can view what has changed, added or removed on each build I commit, [here](https://github.com/TheE7Player/HaggisInterpreter/blob/master/updates.md).



The current scripts runs without any errors:

> There is more scripts as I started the project initially from another forked C# interpreter, had issues after a few days - So I did it by scratch to simplify things.

> Built up from [Timu5](https://github.com/Timu5)'s [BasicSharp](https://github.com/Timu5/BasicSharp)  (How I got into designing evaluators/interpreters)
